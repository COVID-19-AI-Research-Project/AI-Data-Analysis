# Introduction

 The Covid 19 cases World Wide Analysis project is a continuation of COVID-2020 - a data scientist perspective, and gives a more detailed analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic on a global scale. 
 
 The original research showed that based on a population of 20,000,000 - 60,000,00, it will take roughly 1 year for the COVID-19 virus to curve off.<br/><br/>- Original research referenced in: [Covid-19 spread: Reproduction of data and prediction using a SIR model on Euclidean network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07063.pdf "Covid-19 spread: Reproduction of data and prediction using a SIR model on Euclidean network") by Kathakali Biswas, Abdul Khaleque, and Parongama Sen<br /><br/>- Leukemia AI Research Article: [COVID 2020 — A data scientist perspective](https://medium.com/leukemiaairesearch/covid-2020-a-data-scientist-perspective-c135c9e4e90d "COVID 2020 — A data scientist perspective")
